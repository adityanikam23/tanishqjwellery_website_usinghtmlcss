            <h2>Find the right jewellery for you, for every season</h2><br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
            <p>Jewellery is derived from the 13th century French word: jouel and it has been around since the dawn of
                man. But when traced back further, jewellery has its origins in the Latin ‘jocale’ meaning plaything. A
                jewellery is basically any piece of material – animal bone, shell, wood, carved stone, gold or diamond –
                that adorns the human body.</p><br>
            <p>In society, jewellery has always been known to be associated with wealth, power and status. For example,
                in ancient Rome, only certain ranks could wear rings on their fingers. In the Indian culture as well,
                jewellery plays a significant role in conveying ethnic and spiritual meanings. For example, bridal
                jewellery symbolises the welcoming of the bride into her new life as a married woman.</p><br>
            <p>There are many other occasions aside from your wedding to don jewellery, including picking out something
                for office wear, to gift to someone, or just for your everyday wear. Whatever the season, jewellery
                designs have evolved over the years to match contemporary tastes, and even more so in the modern day.
                Latest jewellery is no longer just a jeweller in jewellery stores tinkering and moulding the perfect
                piece against a hot flame; instead with the advent of technology, jewellery today is akin to wearable
                art!</p><br>
            <div class="last-div2">
                <h2>What are the different jewellery styles to choose from?</h2><br>
                <h3>• Traditional jewellery</h3><br>
                <p>Temple jewellery, handmade jewellery, jadau, ivory , and filigree jewellery are some examples of
                    traditional jewellery. They are mostly handmade, display intricate handiwork with and without
                    gemstones. Artisans in India have a long history of producing some of the most exquisite designs
                    modelled on deities, floral and animal designs and embody an old-word charm. The jadau jewellery
                    designs were brought to India by the Mughals and form and intricate mix of design, gemstones, gold
                    and enamelling word. Ivory jewellery is believed to bring a new bride good luck. Filigree on the
                    other hand showcases fine bead work and delicate twists.</p><br>
                <h3>• Traditional jewellery</h3><br>

                    woman’s sensibilities. She seeks convenience and comfort, along with style. Which is why one might
                    find that this jewellery type may steer away from heavy designs as well as precious stones,
                    engravings, gold and diamond, and choose cheap metals, pewter and gold-plated instead. For wearers
                    of fashion jewellery, it is the look and feel of the jewellery that matters.</p><br>
                <h3>• Bridal Jewellery</h3><br>
                <p>As the name suggests, the purpose of this kind of jewellery is extremely specific and given the many
                    different cultures around the world, their variety is possibly innumerable. In India, brides can
                    choose from a wide variety of intricate jewellery designs, stunning patterns and beautiful colours
                    to match her trousseau and glam up her do and her day.</p><br>
